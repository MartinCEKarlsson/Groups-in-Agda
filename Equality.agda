{- We construct a function from x == y to y == x by pattern matching.
   Note that we have written .x for the second argument. These is referred to
   as a "dot pattern" or "inaccessible pattern." It signifies that the second
   argument is forced to be equal to x by the other arguments, in this case
   because the third argument is idp, it is forced to be equal to the second
   argument.

{- We often use the following notation for symmetric.
   We think of this as reversing the direction of a path.
   Note that we have now made x and y into implicit arguments, when
   they weren't implicit for the function symmetric. This
   is often more useful in practice.

{- There is also a stronger version of J known as based path induction
   (in the HoTT book) or Paulin-Mohring J rule. -}

{- Note that in the definition of transitive we only did pattern matching
   on the second argument and left p as it is. This allows us to use idp
   here.
